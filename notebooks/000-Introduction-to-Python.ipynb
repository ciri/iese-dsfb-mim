    "# Introduction to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python** is a programming language, introduced in 1991. The current version is Python 3, though you can still find Python 2 code in the older editions of many books. To work with Python, you will use an interface for which you have many choices available. You can have several \"instances\" of Python, called **kernels**, running independently in your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is **case sensitive**. So, `type` is a Python function that returns the type of an object, but `Type` is not recognized (unless you create a new function with this name), and will return an error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python** is a powerful and widely-used programming language that debuted in 1991. While Python 3 is the current standard, you might encounter Python 2 code in older resources. The language offers flexibility in how you interact with it - you can choose from various interfaces, and run multiple independent instances (called **kernels**) simultaneously on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important detail to remember: Python is case **sensitive**. For example, the built-in function `type` (lowercase) tells you what kind of object you're working with, but writing it as `Type` will trigger an error because Python treats uppercase and lowercase letters as distinct characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Anaconda distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many distributions of Python, but **Anaconda** (`anaconda.com`) is the preferred choice in the data science community. Anaconda comes pre-packaged with most resources needed for this course. When installing Anaconda, select Python 3, and you'll get access to the **Anaconda Navigator** - a browser-based interface for launching various Python environments. For those who prefer command-line tools, you can bypass the Navigator using a **command-line interface** (CLI): Terminal on Mac or the Anaconda prompt on Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, developers favored the **Jupyter Qt console** or **IPython** (Interactive Python). IPython enhanced the basic Python shell with additional features, while the Qt console added a graphical interface with menus and mouse support using the Qt toolkit. IPython introduced **magic commands**, denoted by `%cmd` (like `%cd` for changing directories). While these commands aren't part of Python itself, they're still referenced in many tutorials. For a complete list of magic commands, use `%quickref`. Though you can omit the `%` prefix, we'll keep it to distinguish magic commands from standard Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today's data scientists primarily use IPython's successor: Jupyter. The Jupyter ecosystem introduces the **notebook** paradigm, allowing seamless integration of code, output, and documentation. **Jupyter Notebook** leads this space, with **Apache Zeppelin** a notable alternatives. All of these platforms support multiple programming languages beyond Python, including R. These course materials were developed using a Python-based Jupyter notebook. The page that you are reading right now is a rendered notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda also includes two full-featured Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): **Spyder** and **Visual Studio Code**. These provide comprehensive development tools like consoles, text editors, debuggers, and variable inspectors. While we won't cover these advanced features, users familiar with IDEs (like RStudio for R) may prefer these environments. Feel free to use any tool you're comfortable with, though our instructions will assume you're using Jupyter Notebook, Jupyter Lab or Visual Studio Code - the concepts generally transfer to other interfaces with minimal adaptation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case you are not able to install/run Anaconda on your own computer, it is recommended that you create a google account and use [Google Collab](https://colab.google/) instead (though it has some limitations).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Typing Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Code is typed into code cells like the one below, when you enter that cell and press Shift+Return the code will run and you will get the output underneath. Python returns either an output (preceded by [1]:), a (typically long and difficult) error message, or no answer at all. Here is a supersimple example"

    "\n",
    "* **pip**: The basic Python package installer (`pypi.org/project/pip`), though it may encounter version conflicts between related packages\n",
    "* **conda**: The recommended installer for Anaconda users, as it better manages package dependencies and version conflicts\n",
    "\n",
    "Both `pip` and `conda` can be run directly from Jupyter notebooks, which we'll explore later as the need comes up.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course approaches Python from a data science perspective, we therefore focus on its four core packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **NumPy** (1995): Provides support for large vectors and matrices (called **arrays**) - the foundation for scientific computing in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Matplotlib**: Built on NumPy, this is Python's primary visualization library\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Pandas**: A powerful data management library inspired by R, built on top of NumPy and Matplotlib. Its introduction has significantly increased Python's popularity in data science, making Python/Pandas a common alternative to R\n",

    "There are many books for learning about Python, but some of them would not be appropriate for learning how to work with data in Python. It can even happen that you do not find anything about data in many of them. Mind that Python has so many applications that the intersection of the know-how of all Python users is relatively narrow. For an introduction to Python as a programming language, in a computer science context, I would recommend Zelle (2010). For the self-learning data scientist, McKinney (2017) and VanderPlas (2017) are both worth their price. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is also plenty of learning materials in Internet, including MOOC's. For instance, **Coursera** has a pack of courses on Python (see `coursera.org/courses?query=python`). But, probably, the most attractive marketplace for data science courses is **DataCamp**. They offer, under subscription or academic license, an impressive collection of courses, most of them focused on either R or Python. In addition to follow DataCamp courses, you can also benefit from the **DataCamp Community Tutorials**, which are free and cover a wide range of topics. Finally, a good place to start is [CS dojo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1Yd7upQsXY&list=PLBZBJbE_rGRWeh5mIBhD-hhDwSEDxogDg&index=1).\n"
